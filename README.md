# OpenStreetMap analyses

This repository serves as a reference and guide to my analyses of features within the OpenStreetMap database. 

## Purpose

The main purpose of these analyses are to point out the glaring flaws with American cities and their associated fragility. My goal is to further the message of [Strong Towns](https://www.strongtowns.org/about) and help create more resilient communities across America.

Most of my analyses look at things on a national level, with each city being a data point. But for each data point there is a community that is in need of support, so [please get involved in yours](https://www.strongtowns.org/local).
